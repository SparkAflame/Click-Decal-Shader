## 1.0.1

* Add decal managers for various click effects:

  * Single decal that follows the mouse and pulses continuously.
  * Multiple decals that don't follow the mouse.

* Updated demo scene:

  * New simple mouse button handler that works for all current decal managers.
  * Added an instance of each decal manager to the scene.  Managers can be swapped at runtime.

* Added prefabs to try to make the effect easier to use out of the box.
